# OCD Clinical Demographic Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This data analysis project utilizes Power BI to explore a dataset detailing clinical and demographic information of patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The objective was to transform raw, patient-level data into actionable insights, helping to uncover patterns in disease presentation, demographic risk, and treatment efficacy.

## Features

## Key Features of the Dashboard

Demographic Segmentation: Dynamic filtering and visualizations showing symptom prevalence segmented by Age, Gender, and other relevant demographic variables.

Clinical Severity Mapping: Analysis of Y-BOCS scores mapped against duration of illness and treatment types.

Symptom Subtype Hierarchy: Visual ranking of the most common obsessions (e.g., contamination, symmetry) and compulsions (e.g., checking, washing).

Interactive Filtering: Allows clinicians and researchers to drill down into specific patient cohorts to compare outcomes.
